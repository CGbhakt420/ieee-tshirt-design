*Domain of the Project*

The project is based on:

- *React*: Frontend framework for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- *Three.js*: For rendering and animating 3D models.
- *AI API*: To handle AI-driven apparel customization.

## Idea

Our project aims to create an *Apparel Design Application* where users can input prompts to customize apparel. The AI processes the user input and personalizes the design on 3D apparel models in real time. This app provides a creative and intuitive platform for designing unique apparel tailored to individual preferences.

## Achievements Thus Far

- *Framework Setup*: Successfully integrated React with Three.js and the AI API.
- *3D Model Integration*: Added interactive 3D models of apparel.
- *Prompt Handling*: Enabled AI to process user prompts for design customization.
- Allow users to export their own logos and designs on the apparel.
- *Basic UI*: Developed a user-friendly interface for entering prompts and viewing designs.
